							<h2>A little about me</h2>
						</div><!--// .yui-u -->

						<div class="yui-u">
							<p>As a developer, I advocate passionately for practices like TDD, CI/CD and informal code reviews.  I'm a true generalist engineer, comfortable working in almost all languages or environments, front-end or back-end. I generally prefer to pair-program tough problems, but am comfortable working solo. </p>
							<br>
							<p>As well as delivering awesome software, coaching and sharing of knowledge is my other passion and I enjoy giving talks at meetups or brown-bag lunch time talks on new ideas and ways of working. </p>

								<h2>ThoughtWorks</h2>
								<h3>Consultant Software Developer</h3>
								<h4>2013 January - 2014 April</h4>
								<p>I worked as a consultant software developer at ThoughtWorks. Alongside my regular day-to-day client work, I was involved in a lot of extracurricular coaching, recruitment, and sponsorship programs.</p>

								<p>Internally I worked on a lot of coaching related work aimed at skilling up incoming hires. I alongside another ThoughtWorked designed an 8 week program to help graduates and people with less than three years technical experience pick up crucial development practices (TDD, etc) they would need on the job.</p>

								<p>I was also the technical lead and coach on <a href="http://levelup.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks LevelUp program</a>. This was borne out of an idea to help students bridge the huge gap between what they are being taught at uni, and in the real world. I was involved in designing and running a 9 week course where we taught students Agile fundamentals, and what it means to work as a developer in 2014. Concepts like TDD, CI, pairing and how to deliver software to demanding clients. This program has been hugely successful with over 100 students taught, and hundreds more lectured to.</p>

								<h2>Suncorp/Asteron Life</h2>
								<h3>Consultant Software Developer (through ThoughtWorks)</h3>
								<h4>2013 September - April</h4>
								<p>I was part of a team of client and ThoughtWorks developers that migrated a legacy Java app (pre generic Java) to a more modern stack in preparation for deployment to AWS. This project involved moving away from Spring WebFlow to a traditional REST based architecture. It was a challenging consulting job, as the product spanned 3 regions, had dozens of stakeholders and our team had many other responsibilities to fulfill (alongside this rewrite).</p> 
								<p>With the rewrite came many architectural changes to the product. We were able to successfully break down the large monolithic application into 5 smaller microservices and speed up their continuous delivery process. We also pushed a lot more logic client side as we were given that freedom with the move away from Spring WebFlow.</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.getup.org.au/">GetUp!</a></h2>
								<h3>Consultant Software Developer (through ThoughtWorks)</h3>
								<h4>2013 April - September</h4>
								<p>I was part of a team of GetUp and ThoughtWorks developers brought on to help build some key functionality into GetUp's public campaigning platforms in the lead up to the 2013 elections. The GetUp team had extremely ambitious plans around mobilizing Australia for the elections - this involved building a crowdsourcing platform to help organize 4000 groups of 30 public members to help hand out fliers and T-Shirts on election day.</p>
								<p>We were also involved in building a cross-platform (Android, iOS and mobile-web) app to help deliver GetUp rated scorecards on the major Australian political parties. The interesting aspect of this project was that we had just 18 days from idea to download, compounded by the fact Apple has a 5 day approval process (so effectively 13 days). For more information, read the <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/clients/getup">ThoughtWorks client case study.</a></p>

								<h2><a href="https://github.com/adamhope/sms-voting-game">Speedmingle</a></h2>
								<h4>2013 June</h4>
								<p>Speedmingle is a game I built with some friends at ThoughtWorks designed to be used at events (conferences, meetups etc). The purpose of the game was to get people socializing amongst each other and have a bit of fun. The stack we used was NodeJS and MongoDB on the server with client using web-sockets to make requests and update the scores in realtime. Those scores were then piped through D3.js to give some interesting visualiations. We used BurstSMS as our SMS API provider, and CircleCI and Heroku as part of our deployment pipeline. </p>

								<h2><a href="https://github.com/dbousamra/go-simple-ray">Go Simple Ray </a></h2>
								<h4>2014 February</h4>
								<p>I spent a few evenings in my spare time learning GoLang in preparation for a talk on "How to build a Raytracer" given at the monthly Go meetup. The raytracer is still relatively basic, only rendering spheres and planes, but it was designed and built as simply as possible, in an effort to help the talk. I wanted people to be able to perhaps use it as a point of reference when designing their own raytracing programs. I used JSON as a scene-description language allowing an easy way to serialize and deserialise scenes</p>

								<h2><a href="https://github.com/dbousamra/scala-js-chip8">A CHIP-8 emulator</a></h2>
								<h4>2013 December</h4>
								<p>I spent a week of my personal time building an emulator designed to run 1970's era <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> games and programs. The emulator is built in Scala, but compiles to Javascript. I built the emulator as a learning exercises, and as a platform to test some functional programming theories I had learnt. I also built it with the intention of giving a lecture/talk on basic emulation theory for the ScalaSyd group, as it's very simple and easy to understand.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Android-Bootcamp/">Sydney Android Bootcamp</a></h2>
								<h4>2013 Dec - Present</h4>
								<p>I along with another ThoughtWorker, worked together to create a 6 week Android tutorial for Java developers, aimed at teaching them how to build for Android. The group now has over 110 members, with a core group of 20ish developers attending every week. I worked to build the game we used as the course material I was also the sole developer on the Sinatra REST backend service that the Android clients communicates with. I presented 1 week of the six, and helped manage the meetup.</p>
