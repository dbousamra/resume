Who am I:

My name is Dominic Bou-Samra. I'm a generalist engineer/developer able to work in a variety of challenging environments solving tough problems.



Technical Skills:

I have experience with the following languages and environments:
- Java and the JVM.
- Ruby on Rails.
- JS and NodeJS. I'm comfortable working with Javascript on the frontend. Specifically, I have experience with AngularJS as well as framework-less client-side JS. I also have experience using Node on the server.
- Functional programming. I've spent the three years immersed in functional programming theory and principles, using Haskell and Scala as my languages of choice. I try to use my learnings to push for alternative approaches to solving tough problems in more traditional environments (Java in the enterprise say), even going so far as to actually introduce small Scala microservices with clients.


What I'm like as a developer:
I advocate passionately for practices like TDD, CI/CD and informal code reviews. 
I'm a true generalist developer, comfortable working in almost all languages or environments, front-end or back-end.
I generally prefer to pair-program tough problems, but am comfortable working solo. 
Coaching and sharing of knowledge is a passion. I enjoy giving talks at meetups or brown-bag lunch time talks on new ideas and ways of working. I helped design and implement LevelUp with ThoughtWorks as a way to satisfy this desire on a larger scale. I enjoy pair-programming as a way to help cross-pollinate knowledge amongst a team. 




Experience:

Suncorp: Was part of a team of client and ThoughtWorks developers that migrated a legacy Java app (pre generic Java) to something more modern in preparation for deployment to AWS. This project involved moving away from Spring WebFlow to a traditional REST based architecture. Involved breaking down a large monolithic application into various microservices, 

GetUp: Worked with the GetUp team in the lead up to the 2013 elections. This included 

LevelUp. Helped design and implement from the ground up, initiatives designed to help students bridge the gap between industry and uni. A 9 week course where we taught students agile fundamentals, and what it means to work as a developer in 2014. Things like TDD, CI, pairing and how to deliver software to demanding clients.

Education:

Bachelors of Information Tech
